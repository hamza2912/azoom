                <br/><br/>

                For store credit and gift card refunds, we’ll credit your account within 1 business day once we’ve received notification that you have returned your item(s).
                <br/><br/>
                For credit card refunds, we’ll begin issuing your refund once we’ve received notification that you have returned your item(s). Most banks will process the refund within 3-5 business days.

                For all other refund methods, please allow up to 2 weeks for us to fully process your return and issue your refund.
